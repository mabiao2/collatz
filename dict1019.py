#You are creating a fantasy video game. 
#The data structure to model the playerâ€™s inventory will be a dictionary 
#where the keys are string values describing the item in the inventory and the value is an integer value detailing
#how many of that item the player has. For example,
#the dictionary value 
#{'rope': 1, 'torch': 6, 'gold coin': 42, 'dagger': 1, 'arrow': 12} means the player has 1 rope, 6 torches, 42 gold coins, and so on.
